# serviceapp
App in Flutter connecting users with local service providers (plumbers, electricians, cooks, etc.). Features include real-time bargaining, live location tracking, and flexible pricing. Used Firebase for auth and real-time chat, Restful APIs, Google Maps API for tracking, and state management (Provider/BLoc) for smooth UX.
